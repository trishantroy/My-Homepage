					<p>My competitive nature makes me very well suited for roles that are goal oriented and I excel at developing creative solutions<br/>  to achieve results more efficiently. I have been elected to lead a team of 10 Members which forms the <a href="http://tech-iitb.org/erc">Institute Electronics & Robotics Club</a><br/>  which provides a knowledge and resource sharing platform for enthusiasts. Our aim is to make practical knowledge and technical activities<br/>  more inclusive and accessible to the student population.</p> <br/>
					<p>As a Department Academic Mentor, I work with a team of mentors to ensure that the people graduating from the freshmen year and<br/>  entering the sophomore year go through a smooth transition. This role is more extensive, in that it requires me to have regular oversight<br/> on the student, ensuring their academic load is right, and presenting myself as a confidante they can trust.</p><br/>
				 
				    Being part of these two committees, I have accomplished the following by far:

				    <h2>Positions</h2>
					<h3>Institute Secretary of Technical Affairs | Electronics & Robotics Club Head</h3>

						<li><p>Established HAM(Amateur) Radio Club for students interested in wireless communication, experimentation & radiosport</p></li>

					</ul>
