				<p>I have been a member of the technical team, <a href="http://umiciitb.com/index.html">Unmesh Mashruwala Innovation Cell (UMIC)</a> since my first year. Robotics is a field with piques my interest and UMIC has given a great opportunity for working on projects associated to Robotics.</p>
				<p>Since the past one year, I have been working to design Autonomous Quadcopters capable of human and swarm interaction in a GPS-denied indoor environment to tackle the challenging <a href="http://aerialroboticscompetition.org/rules.php">problem statement</a> in the <a href="http://aerialroboticscompetition.org/">International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC)</a>. It is the longest running collegiate aerial robotics challenge in the world and is managed by the <a href="https://www.auvsi.org/who-auvsi">Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Foundation (AUVSI)</a>.</p>
				
				<p>I am primarily working under Prof. <a href="http://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~leena/">Leena Vachhani</a> on development of a spherical robot sensors that can be used<br/> to explore unknown indoor enviroments. Essentially, my current task is to ensure sturdy and stable motion of the<br/> robot by developing an apt control system. I am also guided by Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plasticoptoelectronicslab/home">Dipti Gupta</a>. Under her guidance, I am working to<br/> select a suitable material which when used to fabricate the robot body will enable us to throw it in desired environments<br/> without damaging it. This is my Bachelor's Degree project and requires me to do a thorough literature survey before <br/>conducting relevant experiments in lab. The experimentation typically involves motion analysis on Viacom Motion<br/> Capture Systems and tensile strength analysis on Universal Testing Machine.</p>

				<p>Using my knowledge of ROS and Gazebo, I am working with the Institute <a href="http://www.auv-iitb.org/">Autonomous Underwater Vehicle </a> team <br/>to make the simulations more realistic with respect to the working environment in order to improve testing time.</p>
